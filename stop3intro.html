<h1>Trent Building history</h1>

<img id="myImage" onclick="changeImage()" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorWXD/VictorWXD.github.io/main/css/images/stop3now.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;cursor:pointer;">

<p>
    In 1922 there was no 'University of Nottingham'. Instead there was 'Nottingham University College', which was opened by then Prime Minister, W E Gladstone in the city centre in 1881. After the First World War the college soon outgrew its original building and it was thanks to a donation of 35 acres of land at Highfields Park by Sir Jesse Boot that the university you know today exists.
    <br>And with that the foundation of the University of Nottingham as you know it today had begun. Following a period of war, pandemic and political instability, the laying of the foundation stone must have seemed a poignant expression of hope and ambition in the future.
    <br>What may also surprise you is that the very same stone which you see pictured back in 1922 is still in situ at the Trent Building today - perhaps for many of you without so much as a passing glance!
    <br>You should be right there, head to the main entrance of the Trent Building in the courtyard and look to your right. A piece of history.
